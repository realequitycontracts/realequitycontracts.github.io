	<p>Rematriate & Rewild your land over time
	Ironically land is not naturally static. It changes shape and changes hands while at the 	same time it’s the picture of stability. No land is an island—in that even an island must 	connect and have a relationship at some point. Put your parcel in the context of the 	greater scheme of things. Set rules for flow in space and time. Connect your parcel to 	the higher system. Determine the contours and the shape by which your piece connects to the whole.
Slowly return shares of land to the tribe. Rewild your land and experiment.
These contracts are inspired by the ancient Hebrew system of land recycling: smhita and yovel.<p>
